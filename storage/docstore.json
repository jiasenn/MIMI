By the 18th century, the term\nwould refer to migrant Indian indentured labourers. In the 19th\ncentury, during the British colonial era, the term would gain a\nnew definition of the systematic transportation and\nemployment of Asian labourers via employment contracts on\nsugar plantations that had been formerly worked by enslaved\nAfricans.[4]\nThe word has had a variety of negative implications. In\nmodern-day English, it is usually regarded as offensive.[1][2][3]\nIn India, its country of origin, it is considered a derogatory slur. In many respects it is similar to the Spanish\nterm pe\u00f3n, although both terms are used in some countries with different implications. \"Coolie\" is now\nregarded as derogatory and/or a racial slur in the Americas (more so in the Caribbean), Oceania, and in\nAfrica and Southeast Asia, in reference to other people from Asia.\nThe word originated in the 17th-century Indian subcontinent and meant \"day labourer\", but starting in the\n20th century, the word was used in British Raj India to refer to porters at railway stations.[5] The term\ndiffers from the word \"Dougla\", which refers to people of mixed African and Indian ancestry. \"Coolie\" is\ninstead used to refer to people of fully-bloode d Indian descent whose ancestors migrated to the British\nformer colonies of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. This is particularly so in South Africa, the Eastern\nAfrican countries, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, other parts of the Caribbean,\nMauritius, Fiji, and the Malay Peninsula.[6][7]\nIn modern Indian popul ar culture, coolies have often been portrayed as working-class heroes or anti-heroes.\nIndian films celebrating coolies include Deewaar (1975), Coolie (1983), and several films titled Coolie No.\n1 (released in 1991 , 1995 , and 2020 ).\nIt is generally unde rstood that the term comes from the Hindi and Telugu word kul\u012b ( \u0958 \u0000 \u0932 \u0940), meaning \"day-\nlabourer\", which is probably associated with the Urdu word kul\u012b ( \u0000 \u0000 \u0000), meaning \"slave\".[8][2] The Urdu\nword is thought  to come from the Tamil word kul\u012b (\"hire\" or \"hireling\").[3] The word k\u016bli, meaning\n\"wages\", is present throughout  the Dravidian langua ge family, with the exception of the North Dravidian\nbranch.[9]\nIt is also thought  that the Hindi word qul\u012b could have originated from the name of a Gujarati aboriginal tribe\nor caste.[10][11]\nThe Chinese word \u82e6\u2f12; k \u01d4l\u00ec is an instance of phono- semantic matching that literally translates to \"bitter\nstrength\" but is more commonly unde rstood a s \"hard labour\".Etymology", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fddd0bf-a709-4e65-8b2a-ac7e99c69c5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fddd0bf-a709-4e65-8b2a-ac7e99c69c5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef56b4ba-ccbd-42f8-a9a9-ef7137ef5373", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "936878e4c5036d00119171a8b8af431f5f9682566fb81a2c1b7b2b09021e6a71"}}, "hash": "936878e4c5036d00119171a8b8af431f5f9682566fb81a2c1b7b2b09021e6a71", "text": "In 1727, Engelbert K\u00e4mpfer described \"coolies\" as dock labourers who would unload Dutch merchant\nships at Nagasaki in Japan.[12][13]\nMerriam-Webster classifies the term coolie as \"usually offensive\".[1] Oxford English Dictionary states it is\n\"dated, offensive\".[2] Dictionar y.com considers it \"disparaging and of fensive\".[3]\nThe importation of Asian labourers into European colonies occurred as early as the 17th century.[14]\nHowever, in the 19th century, a far more robust system of trade involving coolies occurred, in direct\nresponse to the gradual abolition of both the Atlantic slave trade and slavery itself, which for centuries had\nserved as the preferred mode of labour in European colonies in the Americas.[15] The British were the first\nto experiment with coolie labour when in 1806, 200 Chinese labourers were transported to the colony of\nTrinidad in order to work on the plantations there.[16] The \"Trinidad experiment\" was not a success, with\nonly twenty to thirty of the two hundr ed labourers remaining in Trinidad by the 1820s .[14] However, such\nefforts inspired Sir John Gladstone, one of the earliest propone nts of coolie labour, to seek out coolies for\nhis sugar plantations in British Guiana in the hope s of replacing his Afro-Caribbean labour force after the\nabolition of  slavery there in 1833 .[17]\nSocial and political pressure led to the abolition of slavery throughout  the British Empire in 1833, with\nother European nations eventually following suit. Labour-intensive work in European colonies, such as\nthose involving plantations and mines, were left without a cheap source of manpow er.[18] As a\nconsequence, a large-scale trade of primarily Indian and Chinese indentured labourers began in the 1820s\nto fill this need. In 1838, 396 South Asian workers arrived in British Guiana, and such a stream of migrant\nlabour would continue until the First World War.[17] Other European nations, especially colonial powers\nsuch as France, Spain, and Portugal, soon followed suit, especially as Britain, through several treaties such\nas Strangford Treaty and the Treaty of Paris of 1814 , also pressured other nations to abolish their\ninvolvement in the Atlantic slave trade.[15] In most European colonies, the importation of Asian labourers\nbegan in earnest after the abolition of slavery. However, in some colonies, such as Cuba, slavery would not\nend unt il 1886, a bout forty years after coolies were introduc ed.[19]\nA number of contemporary and modern historians noted the influence of the old form of colonial slavery on\nthe coolie system.[20] The coolie trade, much like the slave trade, was intended to provide a labour force for\ncolonial plantations in the Americas and the Pacific which cash crops high in demand across the Atlantic\nWorld.[21][22][23] Coolies frequently worked on slave plantations which had been previously worked by\nenslaved Africans, and similarly brutal treatment could be meted out by plantation overseers in response to\nreal or perceived offences.[20] On some Caribbean plantations, the numbers of coolies present could reach\nup to six hundr ed. In 1878, historian W. L. Distant wrote an article for the Journal of the Royal\nAnthropological Institute, detailing his time spent on West Indian plantations observing the work ethic and\nbehaviors of coolies, and noted that many overseers believed that Asian coolies much like enslaved\nAfricans held an affinity for labour-intensive outdoor labour work.[24] The views of overseers towardsClassification as an offensive term\nHistory of the coolie trade\nAbolition of slavery and rise of the coolie trade", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "384eabb1-7e40-461a-b456-3f834ef95a87": {"__data__": {"id_": "384eabb1-7e40-461a-b456-3f834ef95a87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14a4b304-d73b-4bca-8c40-ce0de349c811", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "275b2532275e8f504707260a5459d7b1232420f8591d02ce8965a5f7efb4a793"}}, "hash": "275b2532275e8f504707260a5459d7b1232420f8591d02ce8965a5f7efb4a793", "text": "coolies differed based on ethnicity: Chinese and Japanese coolies were perceived to be harder working,\nmore unified as a labour force, and m aintained better hygi ene habits in comparison to Indian labourers, who\nwere viewed as being lower in status and treated as children who required constant supervision.[24]\nUnlike slavery, coolie labour was, in theory, unde r contract, consensual, paid, and temporary, with the\ncoolie able to regain complete freedom after their term of service.[15] Regulations were put in place as early\nas 1837 by the British authorities in India to safeguard these principles of voluntary, contractual work and\nsafe and sanitary transportation. The Chinese gove rnment also made efforts to secure the well-being of their\nnation's workers, with representations being made to relevant gove rnments around the world. Some\nWestern abolitionists saw coolie labour as paving the way towards abolition, to gradually and peacefully\nreplace African slave labour without loss of profit.[25] However, other abolitionist groups and individuals\nsuch as the British Anti-Slavery Society and British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society along with American\nabolitionist William Lloyd Garrison were highly critical of coolie labour. Proslavery advocates, particularly\nin the Southern United States, conde mned coolie labour, but used it to argue against the abolition of\nAmerican slavery, claiming the latter was more \"humane\" than the former.[26][27]\nIn practice, however, as many oppone nts of the system argued, abuse and violence in the coolie trade was\nrampant. Some of these labourers signed employment contracts based on misleading promises, while others\nwere kidnapped and sold into servitude; some were victims of clan violence whose captors sold them to\ncoolie merchants, while others sold themselves to pay off gambling debts.[28][29] For those who did sign on\nvoluntarily, they generally signed on for a period of two to five years. In addition to having their passage\npaid for, coolies were also paid unde r twenty cents per day on a verage. However, in certain regions roughl y\na dollar would be taken from coolies every month in order to pay off their debts.[24]\nWorkers from China were mainly transported to work in Peru and Cuba. However, many Chinese\nlabourers worked in British colonies such as Singapore, New South Wales, Jamaica, British Guiana (now\nGuyana), British Malaya, Trinidad and Tobago, British Hondur as (now Belize) \u2013 as well as in the Dutch\ncolonies within the Dutch East Indies, and Suriname.[30][31][32] The first shipment of Chinese labourers\nwas to the British colony of Trinidad in 1806 \"in an attempt to establish a settlement of free peasant\ncultivators and labourers\". On many of the voya ges the labourers were transported on the same vessels that\nhad been used to transport African slaves in the previous years.[33]\nThe coolie-slave trade run by American captains and local agents and mainly consisting of debt slavery,\nwas called the 'pig trade' as the living conditions were not dissimilar to that of livestock; on some vessels as\nmany as 40 percent of the coolies died en route.[34] As many as 500 were crammed into a single ship hold,\nleaving no room to move.[34] The coolies were also stamped on their backs like livestock. Foreign\nmerchants took advantage of the unequal treaties negotiated between the Qing gove rnment and Western\npowers after the Opium Wars, as well as the resulting political and econom ic instability, to broker deals for\n\"contracted\" workers. Anglophone  capitalists referred to the opium trade and captive Chinese labor as\n\"poison and pi gs.\"[35]: 5 Debates over coolie labour\nChinese coolies\nIn European colonies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5514f4c3-c466-4b3d-b90b-96569814e49d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5514f4c3-c466-4b3d-b90b-96569814e49d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca140527-3f17-4c90-beae-706dd249232f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "7aeb1c1a008810f26123b941fc59414bde4e9011cc0aadc903794b521c2ea5a8"}}, "hash": "7aeb1c1a008810f26123b941fc59414bde4e9011cc0aadc903794b521c2ea5a8", "text": "Illustration of the port of Amoy,\nwhere many Chinese labourers were\nshipped to foreign landsPortugue se Macao was the center of coolie slavery: it was described as \"the only real business\" in Macao\nfrom 1848 t o 1873, ge nerating enormous profits for the Portugue se until it was banned due  to pressure from\nthe British gove rnment.[36] Between 1851 and 1874 approximately 215,000 Chinese were shipped from\nMacau overseas, primarily to Cuba and Peru, with some being shipped to Guiana, Suriname, and Costa\nRica.[37]: 82  These coolies were obtained via variety of sources, including some who were entrapped by\nbrokers in Macau through l oans for gambling, a nd ot hers who w ere kidnapped or coerced.[38]: 82 \nIn 1847, two ships from Cuba transported workers to Havana to work in the sugar cane fields from the port\nof Xiamen, one of the five Chinese treaty ports opened to the British by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.\nThe trade soon spread to other ports in Guangdong , and demand became particularly strong in Peru for\nworkers in the silver mines and the guano collecting industry.[39][40][41][42] Australia began importing\nworkers in 1848, and the United States began using them in 1865 on the first transcontinental railroad\nconstruction. These workers were deceived about their terms of employment to a much greater extent than\ntheir Indian counterparts, and consequently, there was a much higher level of Chinese emigration during\nthis period.\nThe trade flourished from 1847 to 1854 without incident, until\nreports began to surface of the mistreatment of the workers in Cuba\nand Peru. As the British gove rnment had political and legal\nresponsibility for many of the ports involved \u2013 including Amoy \u2013\nsuch ports were immediately closed. Despite these closures, the\ntrade simply shifted to the more accommodating port within the\nPortugue se enclave of Macau.[43]\nMany coolies were first deceived or kidnapped and, then kept in\nbarracoons (detention centres) or loading vessels in the ports of\ndeparture, as were African slaves. Their voya ges, which are\nsometimes called the Pacific Passage, were as inhum ane and\ndangerous as the notorious Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave\ntrade.[44][45] Mortality was very high; it is estimated that from 1847 to 1859, the average mortality rate for\ncoolies aboard ships to Cuba was 15.2% , and losses among t hose aboard ships to Peru were as high as 40%\nin the 1850s , and 30.44 pe rcent from 1860 t o 1863.[45]\nThey were sold and were taken to work in plantations or mines with very bad living and working\nconditions. The duration of a contract was typically five to eight years, but many coolies did not live out\ntheir term of service due to hard labour and mistreatment. Survivors were often forced to remain in\nservitude beyond the contracted period. The coolies who worked on the sugar plantations in Cuba and in\nthe guano beds of the Chincha Islands (the islands of Hell) of Peru were treated brutally. 75% of the\nChinese coolies in Cuba died before fulfilling their contracts. More than two-thirds of the Chinese coolies\nwho arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died within the contract period. In 1860, it was calculated that\nof the 4,000 c oolies brought  to the Chinchas since the trade began, not  one had survived.[46]\nBecause of these unbe arable conditions, Chinese coolies often revolted against their Ko-Hung bosses and\nforeign company bosses at ports of departure, on ships, and in foreign lands. The coolies were put in the\nsame neighbour hoods  as Africans and, since most were unable to return to their homeland or have their\nwives come to the New World, many married African women. The coolies' interracial relationships and\nmarriages with Africans, Europeans and Indigenous peoples, formed some of the modern world's Afro-\nAsian and Asian Latin American popul ations.[47][48][49][50][51][52][53]\nIn Spanish, coolies were referred to as colonos asi\u00e1ticos ('Asian colonists').[54] The Spanish colony of\nCuba feared slave uprisings such as those that took place in Haiti, and used coolies as a transition between\nslaves and free labour.

Two scholars of Chinese\nlabour in Cuba, Juan Pastrana and Juan P\u00e9rez de la Riva, substantiated horrific conditions of Chinese\ncoolies in Cuba[55] and stated that coolies were slaves in all but name.[55] Denise Helly is one researcher\nwho believes that despite their slave-like treatment, the free and legal status of the Asian labourers in Cuba\nseparated them from slaves. The coolies could challenge their superiors, run away, petition gove rnment\nofficials, and rebel according to Rodriguez Pastor and Trazegnies Granda.[56] Once they had fulfilled their\ncontracts, colonos asi\u00e1ticos integrated into the countries of Peru, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and\nCuba. They adopted cultural traditions from the natives and also welcomed in non-Chinese to experience\nand participate into their own traditions.[54] Before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Havana had Latin\nAmerica's largest Chinatown.\nThe Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation, of which later\nU.S. president Herbert Hoove r was a director, was instrumental in\nsupplying Chinese coolie labour to South African mines from c.\n1902 to c. 1910 at the request of mine owners, who considered\nsuch labour cheaper than native African and white labour.[57] The\nhorrendous  conditions suffered by Indian coolie labourers in South\nAfrica led to some politicians in the British Parliament questioning\nthe coolie system.[58]\nIn 1866, the British, French and Chinese gove rnments agreed to\nmitigate the abuse by requiring all traders to pay for the return of all\nworkers after their contract ended. The employers in the British\nWest Indies declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an\nend. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000\ncoolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been\nshipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions far worse\nthan those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the\n1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did\nnot get any better \u2013 if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s ,\nan increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and\nthe British, as well as the Chinese gove rnment put pressure on the\nPortugue se colonial authorities in Macau to bring the trade there to\nan end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874.[43] By that time, a\ntotal of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.[59]\nHowever, by 1890, there were still newspaper reports of Coolie\nlabour being us ed in Madagascar.[60]\nThe term coolie was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on c acao plantations in German\nSamoa. German planters went to great lengths to secure access to their \"coolie\" labour supply from China.\nIn 1908, a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on\nGerman plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of\ncolonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914. More than\n2,000 Chinese \"coolies\" were present in the islands in 1914 and most were eventually repatriated by the\nNew Zealand administration.[61]\nDebates over coolie labour and slavery was key in shaping the history of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. In\nFebruary 1862, \"An Act to Prohibit the 'Coolie Trade' by American Citizens in American vessels\", also\nknow n as the Anti-Coolie Act, was signed into law by Abraham Lincoln, which prohibited any U.S.In the United States", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e4a5f08-103c-46fe-a53b-519fd9bd0fc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e4a5f08-103c-46fe-a53b-519fd9bd0fc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dedd8f8e-7746-49ce-a4a0-38db0c4d61b9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "f165738b4aa181210a01fe3ec30a69e45c3ebefeb37bd38d4b618073286577fe"}}, "hash": "f165738b4aa181210a01fe3ec30a69e45c3ebefeb37bd38d4b618073286577fe", "text": "Chinese immigrant workers building the\nFirst transcontinental railroad in the USA.\nHindu festival for the indentured\nIndian workers, on the French colony\nR\u00e9union.citizens and residents from trading in Chinese subjects, know n\nas \"coolies\".[62] In one aspect, the Anti-Coolie Act was the last\nof the U.S. slave trade laws, as well as the beginning of the\nend of slavery; in the September of that year, Lincoln would\nalso issue the Emancipation Proclamation; in another aspect, it\nwas the beginning of Chinese exclusion in the U.S. and the\nbeginning of federal immigration restriction. Within a decade\nsignificant levels of anti-Chinese sentiment had built up, stoked\nby populists such as Denis Kearney with racist slogans \u2013 \"To\nan American, death is preferable to life on a par with the\nChinese.\"[63] In 1868, the Burlingame Treaty would ensure\ncertain protections for Chinese immigrants in the U.S. and\nemphasize that any Chinese immigration to the U.S. must be\nfree and voluntary, reaffirming that \"coolies\", being unfree, were unwelcome and prohibited from entering\nthe U.S. In 1875, Congress would pass the Page Act, which prohibited the bringing of any Chinese\nsubjects without their consent in order to hold them for a term of service.

Although Chinese workers\ncontributed to the building of the first first transcontinental railroad in the United States and of the Canadian\nPacific Railway in western Canada, Chinese settlement was discouraged after completion of the\nconstruction.

They participated in the War of the Pacific, looting and burning down the haciendas\nwhere they worked, after the capture of Lima by the invading Chilean army in January 1880.

Others\nwere sent by C hileans to work in the newly conque red nitrate fields.[65]\nBy the 1820s , many Indians were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad\nfor work, in the hope s of a better life. European merchants and\nbusinessmen quickly took advantage of this and began recruiting\nthem for work as a cheap source of labour.[66][67] British merchants\nbegan transporting Indians to colonies around the world, including\nMauritius, Fiji, New South Wales, Natal, Kenya, Tanganyika,\nSomaliland, Bechuanaland, Seychelles, Uganda, Northern\nRhode sia, Southern Rhode sia, Nyasaland, British Guiana, Trinidad\nand Tobago, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, British Hondur as,\nBarbados, the rest of the British West Indies, and British Malaya.In South America\nIndian coolies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80c3df0c-9358-427e-8201-7b9b2c772c2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "80c3df0c-9358-427e-8201-7b9b2c772c2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c6e320f-2801-48ba-8d9a-3f9129b9739b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "8b81d62e67ba71780e4badbbc07f9e52d8855116b84a0cd5a80d158be3cfb24c"}}, "hash": "8b81d62e67ba71780e4badbbc07f9e52d8855116b84a0cd5a80d158be3cfb24c", "text": "Indentured Indo-Trinidadian and\nTobagonian singing and dancing on\nan estate in Trinidad and Tobago.\nNewly arrived Indian labourers in Trinidad.The Dutch shipped workers to labour on the plantations on\nSurinam, the Netherlands Antilles, and the Dutch East Indies.

They would often deceive the credulous\nworkers about the great oppor tunities that awaited them for their\nown material betterment abroad. The Indians primarily came from\nthe Indo-Gangetic Plain, but also from Tamil Nadu and other areas\nto the south of the country.[43] Indians had faced a great number of\nsocial and econom ic disasters, causing them to be more eager than\nother groups to leave India. In the last part of the nineteenth century alone, there were 24 famines.[74]\nWithout permission from the British colonial authorities, the French transported Indian workers to their\nPacific colony, R\u00e9union, from as early as 1826. By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After\nthis trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to\ntransport over 6,000 workers annua lly, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were\ndiscovered to be taking pl ace.[23][75]\nThe British began to transport Indians to Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, starting in 1829. Slavery was\nabolished there in 1833, with Mauritian planters receiving two million pounds  sterling in compensation for\nthe loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of indentured labourers from India\nto work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were\npresent on the island. T hey worked on s ugar estates, factories, in transport and on c onstruction sites.[76]\nIn 1837, the British East India Company issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for\neach labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the company,\nlimited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for\nreturning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic health\nstandards.[43]\nDespite this, conditions on the ships were often\nextremely crowded, with rampant disease and\nmalnutrition. Coolies were also not informed about the\nlength of the trip or about the island that they would be\ngoing to.[77] The workers were paid a pittance for their\nlabour, and were expected to work in often awful and\nharsh conditions. Although there were no large scale\nscandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies,\nworkers often ended up being forced to work, and\nmanipulated in such a way that they became dependent\non the plantation owners so that in practice they\nremained there long after their contracts expired;\npossibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned\nto their original country of origin. Colonial legislation\nwas also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory pass system was instituted to\nenable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of\nR\u00e9union, Guadeloupe , and Martinique, where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally\nhigh mortality rates were recorded for those working in the mines.[43] Generally, Indian coolies were noted\nto have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.[24] Companies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce4b05f2-186c-40f4-a31b-cebde1bac408": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce4b05f2-186c-40f4-a31b-cebde1bac408", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44926043-4ba2-4503-b4f2-c6663e401e09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "27169bb30da97a56d52d36ad6b2f5ae0ca6ecd1a084232938bee95f504dcc2c6"}}, "hash": "27169bb30da97a56d52d36ad6b2f5ae0ca6ecd1a084232938bee95f504dcc2c6", "text": "Members of the Chinese Labour\nCorps carry out riveting work at the\nCentral Workshops of the Royal\nTank Regiment.would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools.

Though some ships\nhad made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these crimes were\nstill common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children\nwere rarely puni shed, leaving w omen in an even more vulnerable position.[78]\nHowever, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses.\nWorkers were regularly checked up on by health inspectors, and they were vetted before transportation to\nensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children unde r the\nage of 15 w ere not allowed to be transported from their parents unde r any circumstances.[43]\nThe first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of indentured labour to the\nslavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by Joseph Sturge, with the Society of\nFriends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens\nof entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.[79] In response to this pressure, the labour export\nwas temporarily stoppe d in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became know n, but it was\nsoon r enewed due  to its growing econom ic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into\nplace and severe penalties were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were\nshipped to Mauritius.[43]\nIn 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the West Indies, including Jamaica, Trinidad, and\nDemerara, where the Asian popul ation w as soon a  major compone nt of the island de mographic.\nStarting in 1879, many Indians were transported to Fiji to work on\nthe sugarcane plantations. Many of them chose to stay after their\nterm of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the\ntotal popu lation. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch\ncolony of Surinam after the Dutch signed a treaty with the United\nKingdom  on the recruitment of contract workers in 1870. In\nMauritius, the Indian popul ation are now demographically\ndominant, with Indian festivals being celebrated as national\nholidays.[43]\nThis system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing\nfocus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the sensationalist\nmedia of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official\nending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British gove rnment. By\nthat time tens of thousands of Chinese workers were being used\nalong t he Western Front by the allied forces (see Chinese Labour Corps).[80]\nA major difference between the Chinese and the Indian coolie trades was that women and children were\nbrought  from India, along with men, while Chinese coolies were 99% male.[19] Although there are reports\nof ships (so called Coolie ships)[81][82] for Asian coolies carrying women and children, the great majority\nof them were men. This led to a high rate of Chinese men marrying women of other ethnicities such as\nIndian women and mixed-race Creole women. The contrast in the female to male ratio between Indian and\nChinese immigrants has been compared by historians.[83] In Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies just 18,731Sex ratios and intermarriage among coolies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d39377e2-261c-46be-a3f4-ceebb949b1d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "d39377e2-261c-46be-a3f4-ceebb949b1d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "64e0b3e7-407c-484d-9ea8-44ba4867c3da", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Coolie.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Coolie.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "4f4c12f5ecc724e1332fb06ce06ca437050de187907833bb5fecaf56417e268e"}}, "hash": "4f4c12f5ecc724e1332fb06ce06ca437050de187907833bb5fecaf56417e268e", "text": "Chinese women and 92,985 Chinese men served as coolies on plantations.[84] Chinese women migrated\nless than Javanese and Indian women as indentured coolies.[85] The number of Chinese women as coolies\nwas \"very small\" while Chinese men were easily taken into the coolie trade.[86] In Cuba men made up the\nvast majority of Chinese indentured servants on sugar plantations and in Peru non-Chinese women married\nthe mostly male Chinese coolies.[87] Polyandry was a common practice amongst Indian coolies.[88]\nBetween 1845 and 1917, twenty-five percent of all Indians brought  to the Caribbean were women. With\nwomen as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so\nfew women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the\nratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a\nsevere shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner.\nWith a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a\nwoman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.[89] Unfortunately, this also put women in a very\nvulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of\nwomen being bound  and gagged in their own homes by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that\n87 women were murdered with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being\nunfaithful.[89]\nThe scarcity of Indian women in the Caribbean may not have been completely due to the women's inability\nto perform the work required of them. Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a\nway to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The\n1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn\nmade it much more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel\nto the woman's village in order to verify who she was.[90]\nChinese women were scarce in every place where Chinese indentured labourers were brought , the\nmigration was dominated by Chinese men.[91] Up to the 1940s  men made up the vast majority of the Costa\nRican Chinese community.[92] Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico\nand they married Mexican women.[93] One stark difference between Indian and Chinese coolies was the\ntreatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against\nwomen and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian coolies.\nThough this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for people to believe that Indians\nmurder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are\nchaste.[94]\nIn the early 1900s , the Chinese communities in Manila, Singapore, Mauritius, New Zealand, Victoria in\nAustralia, the United States, and Victoria in British Columbia in Canada were all male dominated.[95]\nThough the lack of women became a problem in later years, initially women were not high on the priority\nlist when it came to coolie recruitment. Generally, it was believed that women were unwilling to perform\nthe hard out door labour. Those who di d perform it were still seen as not as good a s men.[96]\nSome Chinese coolies managed to avoid racial discrimination laws in Cuba and marry white women if they\nmanaged to get white in their baptism certificates since the agency that recruited them was meant for\nsettling white people in Cuba.[97][98] A Chinese coolie in Cuba also mentioned a white female master in a\ndeposition.[99]\nIn 2000, the parliament of South Africa enacted the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair\nDiscrimination Act, 2000 .

Other areas of origin\ninclude Shunde  and Donggua n, Fujian and Chao\u2019an, although\nlabourers from these regions were relatively few in number. Their\nhard work contributed to the development of the Straits Settlements,\nboth as colonies and later as the new nations of Singapore and\nMalaysia. Samsui women did manual labour similar to coolies but\nwere considered to be more independent.\nChina faced the problem of overpopul ation in the 19th century and\n20th century. Between 1650 and 1800 during the Qing era, China's\npopul ation nearly doubl ed. However, there were insufficient\nfarmlands to suppor t the rapid popul ation growth. Provinces of\nChina such as Fujian and Guangdong were especially affected.\nMany of them lived in mountainous regions where there was limited land for growing crops. As a result,\nmany C hinese in Southern China suffered from starvation.\nIn Singapore, there were more workers needed to load and unload goods , repair ships, clear jungles for\nsettlements, construct roads and buildings, and provide service for the workers, hence, many immigrants\ncame to Singapore because of the job oppor tunities, higher wages, and be tter living conditions.[2]\nIn Chinese, these women are referred to as Hong Tou Jin (\u7ea2\u5934\u2f31; \u0000\u982d\u2f31; h\u00f3ng t\u00f3u j\u012bn), which means\n\"red bandana\", because of the red cloths they wrapped around their heads. It was this headdress that would\nbecome a trademark feature. The red cloths around their heads also kept their hair clean while they work as\ndust and debris can dirty their hair, since they washed their hair only once a month. The headdress was a\nsquare piece of cloth starched stiff and folded into a square-shaped hat.[3] The colour red was used because\nit caught attention easily, thus reducing the chances of accidents occurring at the construction site.

The dark colours ensured that the clothes would not stain easily. The footwear they typically wore\nwere pieces of rubbe r cut out from used tyres, which they made into sandals by a dding straps.[3]\nComing to Singapore as cheap labourers between the 1920s  and 1940s , it was hard to find jobs in\nSingapore, so the Samsui women worked mainly in the construction industry and other industries that\nrequired hard labour. They also worked as domestic servants.[4] Samsui women were the traditional source\nof manpow er supply in the construction industry, in order to suppor t their families in their hom elands.\nSamsui women typically commenced their work at 8 am, unde rtaking physically strenuous  tasks such as\ndigging soil and transporting earth, debris, and construction materials using buckets suspended from\nshoulder poles. Following a brief lunch break, they occasionally collected wood for cooking fuel before\nconcluding their workday around 5 pm or 6 pm. Once their work was done , they returned home to prepare\ndinner. During the evenings, they engaged in friendly conve rsations with fellow Samsui women along the\nfive-foot-way corridors outside the shophouses where they resided. Additionally, many of them enjoyed\nunwinding by s moking cigarettes before retiring for the night.\nSamsui women earned 50 to 60 cents per day.[3] This was barely enough for their food and rental, and still\nhave to return the money borrowed from the agency to come to find work in Singapore. As a result, they\ngave up the prospect of marriage and children and lived very simply to save money to suppor t their families\nwho they might never see again after they left home. A majority of women would work for about a year to\npay off their debts. They often shared accommodation and ate simple food, such as cooke d rice, some bean\ncheese and a bit of pickled or fresh vegetables. Samsui women dug soil and carried earth, debris and\nbuilding materials in buckets hung from shoulder poles. Despite the long working hours, they only had\nshort lunch breaks, during w hich they were needed to gather wood t o bring hom e as fuel for cooking. T heir\ncontributions to housing construction and as well as labour at hawker centres have been invaluable to\nSingapore's early development.[3]\nUpon arriving in Singapore, Samsui women would make their way to the Chinatown neighbour hood\nlocated between South Bridge Road and New Bridge Road, where many of their fellow samsui migrants\nstayed. They lived in rooms above  shophous es that lined streets such as Upper Chin Chew, Upper Nankin\nand Eu Tong Sen. A room was further subdivided into cubicles, with at least four women sharing one\nsingle room. Rent in the 1930s  to 1940s  ranged from 80 c ents to $1.20 a  month.[3]Blouse/ Samfoo\nJobs\nSocial interactions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90681ccc-de83-40a8-a73f-5cfa3aac3bf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "90681ccc-de83-40a8-a73f-5cfa3aac3bf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Samsui_women.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Samsui_women.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e6ad544-495b-4f1c-a464-ec55d8ceb8ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Samsui_women.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Samsui_women.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "d0a4a87c4ad3817d63645d10c388b42485fd9bf78bf808e04ce0c6a85aff8ab1"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c27f01c-70db-4aa8-a2e3-1fd62c7e326f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Samsui_women.pdf", "file_path": "testdata\\Samsui_women.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-30", "last_accessed_date": "2023-10-31"}, "hash": "bdc710f8eba2c10828d173b0755b834842435e9a3211aa5ac4a13c2166bbc69a"}}, "hash": "a5663c352797a72ab3d648e3f8e1425be2b24d8df59d8d89e676db9c5a50f02d", "text": "Samsui women also remained in touch with their relatives back home in China, communicating with them\nfrequently through letters. As Samsui women hailed mostly from the poorer parts of China, they were\nmostly illiterate, and hi red professional letter writers to write the letters for them.[5]\nOrganisations exist to raise awareness of these women's achievements and contributions to Singapore's\ndevelopment, and their current state. Some of these organisations also strive to provide free travel for the\nwomen back to China to visit their relatives before they die. One such organisation was the Sam Shui Wai\nKuan Association that took c are of the needs of Samsui women.\nAs of 2014, there was only two remaining Samsui women, Ng Moey Chye, who was born in Singapore to\nmainland C hinese parents[6] and W oo Yum Sum.[7] In 2020, W oo di ed.[7]\nThe travails of the Samsui women were portrayed in Samsui Women, a television drama series produc ed by\nSingapore Broadcasting Corporation in 1986, which has widely been considered as one of the best dramas\nSingapore has produc ed over the years.[8] There was also a theatrical play by The Finger Players, called\n\"Samsui Women: One Brick at a Time\", held at the Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the Bay.[9]\nDuring the 2018 National Day Parade, a short film depicted the real-life stories of five Singaporeans,\nincluding that of a former samsui woman.[7][10]\n1.
