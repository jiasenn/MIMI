Paragraph,"Singapore’s thriving entrepôt and much talked about commercial vibrancy attracted poverty-stricken Chinese to the island in droves. In search of work and fortune, they took the plunge, boarding overcrowded junks for a perilous journey by sea."
Paragraph,"The first bulk of arrivals in Singapore were mainly men who took on backbreaking work moving commodities and cargo from sea vessels to warehouses along the Singapore River.1 Known as coolies, these indentured labourers also worked in construction, agriculture, shipping, mining and rickshaw-pulling.2 As the port town of Singapore evolved, it received a regular influx of Chinese male immigrants. By and large, they came in three large waves between 1823 and 1927."

Paragraph,"Unfortunately, life was far from rosy. On top of desperately low wages, and miserable living conditions, the majority of them owed money to middle-men from clan associations and secret societies for arranging passage and work in Singapore. Clan associations were far more understanding of their plight, granting them lodging and protection, as well as aid via mutual assistance schemes. However, immigrants who cut deals with secret societies had to pay membership fees to cover costs in the event they fell ill or died here. As a means of escape, many gambled or smoked opium."
Paragraph,"Along the way, the authorities in Singapore curbed the number of male immigrants to the colony and relaxed its policies towards female emigration to even out the gender ratio. Between 1934 and 1938, 200,000 women, affected by economic challenges and a slew of natural calamities in China, came to Singapore."
Paragraph,"Here, they found work in tin mines and rubber estates. Those who did general labour at construction sites around the island came to be known as samsui women. They primarily hailed from poor regions in China such as the Samsui district. Their work day usually started at 8am and they were largely tasked to dig soil. They carried earth, debris and building materials in buckets hung from shoulder poles. After work, they returned to tiny shared rooms in Chinatown."
